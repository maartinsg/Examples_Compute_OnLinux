# Examples Compute On Linux

Because not everything was provided in computers so some examples to edit "compilables" are put here, example:
GCC compiles though "file-5.44.tar.xz" package has not provided ./configure and ../src/file -C -m mag?? for mag??.mgc file for 'dietlibc enabledness' so some edits have been performed like 'sed -e 's@-C -m magic@-C -m magic/magic@g' -i magic/Makefile and after ./configure --prefix= --enable-static --disable-shared --build=x86_64-pc-linux --host=x86_64-pc-linux build_alias=x86_64-pc-linux-dietlibc host_alias=x86_64-pc-linux-dietlibc host=x86_64-pc-linux-dietlibc build=x86_64-pc-linux-dietlibc 

And so on, comprehensible.
