There was some inCompatible "LV_PINTool_software" SourceCodeText.
Did not compile on some ( Linux ) distributions properly, lib*.a files were not 'matching'.

Some hints (less writing at google.com ? ) when compiling software:

to compile "WxWidgets" please ./configure with also =internal on those three graphical formats;

rewwriting Makefile hostedfile on e..I...D.... software at GitHub.com maybe is a solution;
